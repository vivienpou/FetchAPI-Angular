# PROJECT ANGULAR-6 HTTP REQUEST FROM EXTERNAL API 
This webpage do a request every minute to an API.
For each request, it displays the time it happened, the delays for the http response from request, and how long minutes ago we did this request.

The page is composed four sections:
On the top, we find a navbar with a searchbar, and the logo of Geev on the left side.
On the left, a side bar with a link to the homepage.
On the middle of the page, we have the title and then two windows which displayed:
    - the project of the webpage: a web api livestatus
    - the percentage of success of http-get-requests.
On the bottom of this, we generate rows inside a table for each http get request done.

Hope you will enjoy!
